## Computer Vision Projects
### Custom StarGAN
I trained a cycleGAN using the StarGAN_V2 architecture. I trained the model on a custom dataset that comprised of faces of Black celebrities. 
The premise of this project was to train a cross domain style transfer model which can perform better on Black faces. 
This project is still ongoing hence the repository and data is still private.

### [Hairstyle Detector App](https://www.google.com)

This is a hairstyle detection model that was trained on images of Black women with a wide variety of hairstyles. 
I created a CreateML model that I added to an iOS app that I created and installed on my phone. 
The app allowed me to access photos from my gallery and correctly classify the hairstyle on the individual in the image.

### [Hand Pose Prediction](https://github.com/TabithaKO/CS585-HW2)
My team and I used traditional computer vision techniques such as template matching to identify 5 distinct hand poses and draw a bounding box around the hand. 
In this project my partner and I utilized skin color detection and OpenCVs template matching algorithm to complete this task.


### [Kalman Filter Multiple Object Tracking](https://github.com/TabithaKO/MultipleObjectTracking)
I worked with two classmates to design an algorithm that we used to track and estimate the trajectories of multiple objects (flying bats) in a frame of a video. 
By applying the algorithm on multiple frames we were able to track the trajectories across an entire video.




## Robotics Projects
### [Robotic Arm](https://github.com/TabithaKO/Cerebella)
I assembled a robotic arm using servos and servo brackets available on Amazon. 
I used an Arduino to control the servos and a Raspberry Pi to send signals to the Arduino based on a pose detection model. 
The pose detection model I used was OpenPose. I translated the pose detection predictions from the model into actionable servo signals to control the robotic arm.

### [Soft Robotic Hand](https://github.com/TabithaKO/SoftRobot)
I designed a robotic hand using Shapr3D (CAD software) and a standard 3D printer. 
I designed some soft robotic muscles using silicone and some Arduino contolled air pumps. 
I combined the soft robotic muscles and the hand to create an actuated robotic hand.


### [Self Driving Toy Car](https://github.com/TabithaKO/CarProject)
In this project I assembled a robotic car kit and attached a Raspberry Pi camera at the head of the car. 
I trained an object detection model based on common household items. I wrote a python program to control the car based on the object detected in its path.
This project inspired the most recent version of the [Data Science in Action summer camp](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/machine-learning-for-self-driving-cars/).
